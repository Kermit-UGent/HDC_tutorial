**Author**: Michiel Stock (michiel.stock@ugent.be)

This is an accessible tutorial about hyperdimensional computing (HDC), with an emphasis to the life sciences. We start from the basics, explaining the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces, the logic of the operations of HDC and its applications. Everything is supported by interactive examples, where you will:

- compare amino acids;
- build a language classifier;
- compute with colors;
- learn how to design a transmembrane domain for synthetic biology.
